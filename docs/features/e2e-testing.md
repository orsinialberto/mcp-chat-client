# E2E Testing - Specification

## Overview
Implement end-to-end testing with Playwright to verify the chat application works correctly after each feature development. Tests must validate both API responses and UI rendering.

## Problem Statement
### Current Issues
- No automated way to verify the complete user flow works
- API might respond but UI could fail to render messages
- Manual testing after each feature is time-consuming and error-prone
- No guarantee that new features don't break existing functionality

## Proposed Solution
Use Playwright for E2E tests that:
- Start the Next.js dev server automatically
- Send test messages through the chat interface
- Verify API responses are received
- Confirm messages appear in the UI
- Detect rendering bugs (API responds but UI doesn't update)

## User Experience
### Before (Current State)
Developer must:
1. Manually start the app
2. Type test messages
3. Visually verify responses appear
4. Repeat after every feature change

### After (With E2E Tests)
Developer runs:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
Playwright automatically:
- Starts the app
- Runs all test scenarios
- Reports success/failure with screenshots
- Identifies API vs UI issues

## Technical Approach
- **Tool**: Playwright (Next.js recommended)
- **Test Location**: `e2e/` directory
- **Config**: `playwright.config.ts`
- **Coverage**: Critical user flows (send message, receive response, new chat)
- **Validation**: Both network layer (API) and presentation layer (DOM)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Playwright installed and configured
- [ ] Test verifies message sending
- [ ] Test confirms API response received
- [ ] Test validates UI displays response
- [ ] Test detects API-UI sync issues
- [ ] Test checks localStorage persistence
- [ ] Tests run in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] All tests pass before deployment

## Future Enhancements
- Visual regression testing
- Performance metrics tracking
- Multi-browser testing (Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile viewport testing
